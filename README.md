Tic-Tac-Toe React app for GeniusCrew

I designed and built local multiplayer version because I believe people should socialize and play such games physically more
rather than the steady virtual lives we live these days. This is a better way to connect with friends you have over: 
share your phone or pc while enjoying a game with them!
